I soon found that juggling the time demands of work and family life made it very difficult to maintain my personal fitness at the level I had become accustomed to in the military. To help stay in shape, I ran the Las Vegas marathon every year, but came to realize that running was doing nothing to help maintain my upper body and related muscles. I looked to find a solution that would allow me to get an upper body workout while running and perform every calisthenic exercise imaginable outside but could not find anything suitable on the market. I set out to solve this problem. The result is the Olympus Grip, a comprehensive exercise product for all your fitness needs.<br/></p>",
